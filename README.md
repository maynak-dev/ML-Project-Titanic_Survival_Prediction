# Titanic Survival Prediction  
A machine‑learning project to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using the classic Kaggle dataset.

## 🚀 Overview  
This project uses Python and machine‑learning techniques to predict whether a passenger aboard the RMS Titanic survived the disaster. The model uses features like age, gender, ticket class and more to make predictions.

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit‑learn  
- Model(s): Logistic Regression, Random Forest (and possibly other classifiers)  
- Data: Titanic passenger dataset (train.csv, test.csv)

## ✨ Key Features  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns by gender, class, age, etc.  
- Data cleaning & preprocessing: missing value imputation, drop irrelevant columns (e.g., Cabin, Ticket)  
- Feature engineering: convert categorical variables, create age groups, fare bands, etc.  
- Model training & evaluation: try multiple classifiers, compare metrics, pick best performing.  
- Prediction generation: produce output for unseen test set submission.  

## ✅ Getting Started (Development)  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/maynak‑dev/ML‑Project‑Titanic_Survival_Prediction.git
   cd ML‑Project‑Titanic_Survival_Prediction
   ```  
2. **Create a virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```  
3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
4. **Run notebook or scripts**  
   - Open the notebooks under `notebooks/` for EDA and modelling  
   - Alternatively run the Python scripts if provided  
5. **Generate predictions**  
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set  
   - Save the submission file (e.g., `PassengerId`, `Survived`) for evaluation  

## ⚠️ Notes & Configuration  
- The baseline model may deliver moderate accuracy; further tuning may improve results.  
- Make sure to handle missing values carefully (e.g., Age, Embarked) and drop/recode non‑useful features (e.g., Cabin, Ticket).  
- For production or more serious modelling, consider cross‑validation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble methods, and proper evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy.  
- If expanding dataset or features, adjust scripts and notebooks accordingly.

## 🛠️ Next Steps & Potential Enhancements  
- Add more classification algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM, SVM) and compare performance  
- Use feature selection techniques to find optimal feature set  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV)  
- Add performance metrics such as precision, recall, F1‑score, ROC AUC  
- Deploy the model (e.g., via a web service or simple UI)  
- Document the workflow & findings in more detail (e.g., summary of insights from EDA)
